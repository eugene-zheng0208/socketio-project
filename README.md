Socket.IO Testing with Node.JS
===============================
This project was created to explore some quick and easy socket.IO testing.

Getting Started
---------------
This sample testing assumes you have [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) installed globally on your system:
	
	$ npm install -g mocha

Once Mocha has been installed globally, you can run these tests at the root level of this project with

	$ mocha -R spec
